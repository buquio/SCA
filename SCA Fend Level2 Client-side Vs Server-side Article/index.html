<header> Introduction </header>
	<p class="text">In talking to a few beginners recently, I found out that they often see these words <span class="underlined">client-side & server-side</span>
     being thrown around and they can be a bit confusing. 
     And if there’s one thing that a beginner doesn’t need, it’s more confusion.
    Here’s my attempt at clearing up the confusing and making life slightly easier for them.
    These terms essentially aim to clarify where a particular operation is happening. 
    Is it happening on the server or on the client?</p>
    <p class="text"> To download stuff from the internet and display it to you, often in the form of a web page.
        It also takes your input; button clicks, text you input into text fields and sends it to the internet, 
        so that the internet can do magic with that input and respond with hopefully, more relevant things.
        An example of this flow is a sign up form.You type a url into your browser and it tells the internet “hey, give me the data at that url”.
        The internet sends “HTML & CSS” back to you. HTML & CSS are just instructions for your browser to what to display;
         “Your browser, show the user a white page, two text fields somewhere in the middle, a blue button…
         ” Your browser downloads this HTML & CSS, reads it and then shows you the webpage.
        You type some text into the text fields, and then click the button using JavaScript to submit the form.

<section class="server-section main-section" id="server_section">
	<header>what is a server?  </header>
    <p class="text"> 
        Simply put: a server, in this context, is a computer that is on the internet.
        “The internet” is just a collection of many many servers; 
        many computers (with no screens attached to them) doing magic and sending the results to your browser for your enjoyment.
    <p class="text"> 
        What this means is that, in the example above, your browser was talking to a server.
        It’s the server that takes the input from the user (her name, email address etc) and saves it for later use.
        This is why you can pick up any device, with any browser and sign in to your favourite social network and 
        it will have all your details saved and ready to go; it’s all on the server.
        Now that we have some idea of what the server is, let’s talk more about what your browser is.

<section class="client-section main-section" id="client_section">
	<header>What is a client? </header>
    <p class="text"> 
        The client is the software that runs on the user’s computer (your laptop, iPad, smartphone) that is capable of communicating with a server.
        In this, the client is your browser. It can interpret the information (HTML & CSS, images, videos) that the server sends and display them,
         in the form that you’ll understand. 
        It can take your input (text, avatars, video recordings) and send them to the server to manipulate and/or save. 
    <p class="text"> 
        Another kind of “client”, one you probably use every single day; mobile & desktop applications.Let’s take the Facebook mobile app for
         example:It runs on the user’s computer (your smartphone).
It sends and receives information to/from a server. Think about it. If you bought a new phone today & signed into the Facebook app, 
it’ll display information (your comments, pictures, likes etc) that you’ve saved to Facebook prior to that day. How does it get that information? It asks the Facebook server to send them over.

    <header>Client-side &  Server-side JavaScript</header>
    <p>
        Javascript is the language that brings interactivity to the web. 
                JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.It
                is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser)JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing 
        it with additional objects; for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
      </ul>
     
  </section>
      
      <section class="main-section javaScript-implementation-section" id="javaScript-implementation">
    <header> JavaScript Implementation</header>
      <p>
     To use JavaScript to bring interactivity to your website you should be able to do the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>create variables</li>
        <p>
        variables as symbolic names for values in your application.You can declare a variable 
        For example,<code> let name = "Ann";</code>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.</p>
      <code>if (true) { var name = "Ann"; } console.log(name); // Ann</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.</p>
      <code>if (true) { let name = "Ann"; } console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not
        defined</code>

        <li>write a function</li>
       <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
      statement) consists of the function keyword.
      For example, the following code defines a simple function:</p>
      <code>function area(lenght, width) { 
          return lenght * width; }
        </code>
        

        <li>write a conditional statement</li>
       <p> condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.</p>
      <code>if ('hello') {
        console.log('run');
      } else {
        console.log('skipped');
      }
      </code>
        
      <li>create a loop</li>
        <li>manipulate the elements on a page with Javascript</li>
      </ol>

<header>server-side operations </header>
    <p class="text">  
        The most common example of server-side operations are those that have to do with data storage and retrieval.
        Let’s continue with Instagram as the example.
        As people sign up via the Instagram application & upload pictures, Instagram’s server(s) save all this information to a database that exists on the server.
         Though it is possible to save images & data on your mobile phone, it doesn’t make sense for your device to store every single profile, their pictures and videos on every
          device that has the Instagram application. It’s not even possible. There are simply no mobile devices that can store that size of information.
    <p class="text"> 
        This is why, every time you want to find a user’s profile and view their information, you have to wait a bit for the results & 
        images to load.During this wait period, the Instagram mobile application sends your search query to the server.
         The server looks through millions of users & records to find the ones you might be looking for and sends it back to the client.
         This “searching” is a server-side operation.It is the job of the software development team to decide whether an operation 
         will be done client-side or server side (based on their inherent constraints) to deliver the best experience to the user.

<header class="section-title">client-side operations</header>
    <p class="text"> 
        As explained above, the client is a piece of software that runs on the user’s computer that communicates with the server.
        But communicating with the server is not all the client does.Let’s consider the Instagram mobile application:As we know, 
        Instagram is a social network for sharing & consuming images.
        Instagram lets you see pictures of people you follow (by downloading these images from the server and displaying them to you).
        It also lets you upload pictures for others to see (it takes your images, your expertly composed captions and sends it to the server).
    <p class="text"> 
        One cool feature of instagram is that it lets you apply a filter to your image before sharing it with the world.
        “A filter is software routine that changes the appearance of an image or part of an image by altering the shades and 
        colours of the pixels in some manner”.In Instagram’s case, this filter is done within the application itself. 
        What this means is that, the Instagram mobile application developers wrote code to manipulate the images right on your smartphone.
This is known as a client-side operation.
